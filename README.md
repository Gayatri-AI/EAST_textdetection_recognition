# EAST_textdetection_textrecognition
Text detection and recognition in images as well as real time video using [EAST algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03155)

The purpose of this project is to recognize text from natural images using OpenCV and Tesseract. Optical character recognition is used to make editable or even digitised text from scanned images and photographs. In this project we have tried to implement these techniques on natural images.We have also tried to extend these scene text extraction techniques to real time videos.This made our code more versatile and resourceful.

 Scene text detection basically refers to detecting text that is embedded in natural images. This can be done using various techniques. One such technique is to use MSERs i.e. to use maximally stable extremal regions. In this project we have tried to implement the EAST algorithm to achieve the same. EAST text detector uses a single deep neural network for accurate and fast detection of text.For the purpose of text recognition, we have usd Tesseract engine.
